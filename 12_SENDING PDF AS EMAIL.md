### SAP alreeady provided function module to convert XString to Binary
### This function module will convert from xsring to binary.

### use solix_tab as a type reason we will discuss further

# Step 3Ô∏è‚É£:
### now we will comeon to classes.
#### whenever we want to create send request we use ### CL_BCS class
### now we wil go to se24. se24 is the tcodefor the global classes.


- Goto patern > goto abap object pattern
- Give the name of class and method
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/00966703-f23b-4c61-bf6f-f576b5abcb94)
- Create_persistant is used to create a send request.
- Declare an object of type cl_bcs
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/ba97351e-e946-4362-b3a1-058b37e5eb00)

# Step 4Ô∏è‚É£:
## Create the sap user/external user

#### - firstly we need to create the receipient and then we can pass it so lets create the receipient first.
#### - we have 2 classes to create the recepiemt
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/6cfa5dc6-0478-4d37-b756-3caead24ebab)

## # LEtsss say we are doing for SAP USER
- Go to se24 and pass the class
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/da2a2339-c152-4d17-84f5-4daca8581609)
- we will use the create method to get the sap user.
- goto pattern > abap object pattern > pass class and method
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/a987bdcf-81f6-448b-95fb-f362b7730541)

- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/ddfa68f2-8514-4265-a7fd-0ba66dade78d)
- WE have created the user now we need to create the recepient. we will use add_recepient method
- ####### NOTE:: add_recepient is an instance method so we need to call with object.
- so we will go to pattern abap object pattern and pass the clss instance and method
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/331d4e92-8ac6-462c-b8c9-f21f3afc685f)
- we can simply pass the object of our recepient
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/3c667dc0-90fe-464f-b318-dc357b8a7234)
- 



# NOW WE WLL SEEE HOW CAN WE CREATE THE EXTERNAL USER
### we can use the ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/4b5b37bf-f769-481c-aaf7-0718a1b0f9f0) method to create the external class.



‚û° we will goto pattern > abap object pattern & pass class&method

‚û° we created the user now we need to add user as recepient

# NEXT STEP 6Ô∏è‚É£ - CREATE THE DOCUMENT

- WE WILL GOTO SE24 TCODE(GLOBAL CLASSES)
- WE WILL GOTO ##CL_DOCUMENT_BCS
- WE WILL USE CREATE_DOCUMENT STATIC METHOD
- ##LETS MOVE TOWARDS DOCUMENTATION CREATION
- WE WILL PASS THECLASS AND METHOD
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/f3c4bb0e-17c6-412e-9e88-5b0c52584210)
- 
- WE WILL DECLARE INTERNAL TABLE AND WA FOR I_TEXT(MAIL BODY)
- ![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/364d43d4-94ed-42ec-b464-1889b732876f)

### NOW WE NEED TO INSERT THE DATA TO LT_TEXT INTERNAL TABLE
#### SO FIESTLY WE WILL PASS THE DATA TO WORKAREA AND THEN APPEND IT TO INTENRAL TABLE
![image](https://github.com/bhuvabhavik/SMARTFORMS/assets/49744703/f8ae5110-87c6-42e8-9567-c42acb8bed58)

>[NOTE]
>WITH THE HELP OF #CL_BCS CLASS WE CREATED THE SEND PROCESS AND WE ADDED THE RECEPIENT.
>WITH THE HELP OF SECOND CLASS #CL_DOCUMENT_BCS WE SIMPLY CREAEED THE DOCUMENT AND ADDED THE ATTACHENT.
>JUST THINK WE HAVE USED TWO SEPERATE CLASSES BUT IS THERE ANY LINK BETWEEN THEM? ##NO

>

## SO IN THE NEXT STEP WE WILL LEARN THAT

# STEP 7Ô∏è‚É£: SET THE DOCUMENT.

### _WE WILL PASSTHE OBJECT OF DOCUMENT CLASS. WE NEED TO LINK BOTH OF THEM
____
## NOW WE NEED TO WORK ON THE SEND üì© BUTTON
## üö® BEFORE SEND WE NEED TO WORK ON ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE IMMEDIATE SENDING
###CURRENTLY WE WILL GO FOR IMMEDIATE SNEDING ONLY
CALL METHOD THROUGH OBJECT AS ITS A INSTANCE
